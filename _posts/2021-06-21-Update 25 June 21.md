## Camping with Scouts in Sierras

I mentioned this in the subsequent update video... but I was gone this week... off the grid.  Camping with my kids' Scout Troop at Camp Winton.
For Bay Area and Northern California folks... this is SW of South Lake Tahoe.  Winton is a little closer than Kirkwood Ski Resort.   The time leading up to and just after this week was a bit down on productivity.  No new features.  No big marketing push.  Because the app is will a solo effort, schedule time away has an effect of nulling marketing efforts leading up to that time.    Photos:
