## Additional Update Coming 

Update coming later today or tomorrow for week starting July 12 and July 19.

Last week was slow on progress due out of town, personal visit from my Dad.  

We did apply to the Revtechlabs Insuretech / Fintech Accelerator this fall.  Looking at other Accelerator programs as a potential benefit at our stage.

This week... working on content, features updates including email notifications, marketing embeds, widgets and landing pages. 
Content calendar and social calendar, PDF fills, and graphics upgrades.  

<!--more-->

Will include notes on YC Co-founder Matching, Pioneer.app, and August YC Build Sprint. 

Additional musings on co-founders, accountability, and finding PT Ruby on Rails or pushing forward sales goals and funding goals??
