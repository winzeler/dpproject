## Contract to Close Gets All the Attention. 
## Why?

In the software ecosphere around mortgage "manufacturing"... ie, sales, origination, processing, closing and post-closing, secondary marketing.... the Contract to Close section for processessing and closing get the majority of the investment and attention. This is the obvious place where consumers are most impacted by the user experience (ignoring servicing here). However, the cost to originate a loan is skewed heavily by the sales commissions paid to originators to woo real estate agents, get referrals and convert leads.  

If the work of a loan originator is largely BEFORE the Contract on a purchase, isn't it strange there is little attention paid and little investment made in this BEFORE Contract stage?

Where are the software tools focused before the contract?  Where are the differentiated ideas and services to create mortgage demand?
