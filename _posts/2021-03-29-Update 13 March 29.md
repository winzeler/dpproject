_Here is a rough list of dev activity in the last week.  A few key fixes... but the most exciting thing is the new website starting._

### Start new main website!!!

Update Roadmap URLs.  Need to update the content on the Public and Partner roadmap to make sure it's keeping pace.  Focusing on bigger items on these resources.

Fix edge case in newpartner, newclient registrations where missing trailing slash and missing id did not generate correct URL from cookie, defaults.

return_id links for community links into peerboard.  user is directed to the correct place.
