*In late 2019, I put together a PDF about the Mortgage Guidelines for Bridal Gift Funds, aka Wedding Gift for Down Payment and Closing.  I tried to give the history of this guideline area in FHA and Conventional, up to the most recent 2017 Freddie Mac guidelines.  This is a brief copy-paste of that effort.*
